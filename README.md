# SpringBatchProcessing
Spring Batch is a lightweight, comprehensive framework designed to facilitate development of robust batch applications. 
It also provides more advanced technical services and features that 
support extremely high volume and high performance batch jobs through its optimization and partitioning techniques.

Spring Batch provides reusable functions 
that are essential in processing large volumes of records, 
including logging/tracing, transaction management, job processing statistics, 
job restart, skip, and resource management. It also provides more advanced technical services and 
features that will enable extremely high-volume and high performance batch jobs through optimization and partitioning techniques. Simple as well as complex, high-volume batch jobs can leverage the framework 
in a highly scalable manner to process significant volumes of information.
